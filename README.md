# You Can't Open 16.3 Million Records in Excel

Once data becomes large enough or calculations become complex enough (or a whole host of other reasons), it becomes infeasible to work with Excel (or other spreadsheet options). Instead, users must look to other tools to work with the data. That could be a business intelligence tool like Tableau or Power BI. That could also be a programmatic languages like Python or R. 

This repository is used as part of the workshop demonstrating how to use a programmatic language, specifically R, to do Exploratory Data Analysis.
